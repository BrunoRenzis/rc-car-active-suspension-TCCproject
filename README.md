🚗 RC Car with Active Suspension – Technical Project
📌 Overview

This project was developed as a final technical project in Mechatronics.
The objective was to design and build a remote-controlled (RC) vehicle operated via mobile application, featuring an active suspension system controlled electronically.

The project integrates embedded systems, control logic, mechanical structure design, and software development.
